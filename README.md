GroundingDINO: Image Cropping and Outpainting Tool

GroundingDINO is a powerful image processing tool designed for cropping images around a desired region of interest and generating outpaintings using generative AI. This tool is particularly useful when you want to focus on specific areas within an image or extend the content of an image beyond its original boundaries.
Features

    Image Cropping: GroundingDINO allows you to crop images around a region of interest, creating rectangular images with a size of 512x512 pixels. This feature is invaluable when you want to isolate specific elements within an image.

    Outpainting with Generative AI: When the original image is smaller than 512x512 pixels, GroundingDINO utilizes generative AI to extend the image content seamlessly. This process, known as outpainting, generates additional visual elements, ensuring a coherent and natural extension of the image.
